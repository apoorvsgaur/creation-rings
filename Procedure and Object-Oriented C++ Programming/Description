                                         Class 12 - Final Project Demonstration

Along with a partner, we were asked to design a point-of-sales Super Market Cash counter using Class and Objects in C++ as a final project for our 12th Grade Final Exams. 
Using classes and user-defined functions, we successfully recieved full credit for our code. 

Attached in this folder is the code and the documentation for this project.
