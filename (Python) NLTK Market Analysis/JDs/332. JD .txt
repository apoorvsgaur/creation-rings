Let us put it this way; we want people to work with us. Because when you think of it, there's a big difference. At LIQVD ASIA, we believe more in partners than employees. Our team is right now brimming with ideators, innovators, geek, marketers and human experience strategists. Think you can fit right in?

Your knowledge about how to build mobile apps is surely a value add. Even better if you like both Android &amp; iOS. Nonetheless if you think you are the smartest thing living on earth &amp; you crave providing solutions, we would like to meet you anyway.
