Nilenso is an employee-owned technology cooperative in Bangalore. We have built our business on an "experiment culture"; we take calculated risks and measure outcomes. This post has a title suffix of "again" because we have had some fantastic luck with the HasJob board in the past, due in part to peoples' interest in the existence of a completely transparent "technology cooperative". Here are the two key points:

1) Every employee (including you!) owns an equal share of the company. Hence, you will own nilenso.

2) Every employee (including you!) helps run the company. Hence, you will run nilenso.

First, a little about us: nilenso is a profitable consultancy and product incubator. People working on products are 100% on products. People doing consulting are 100% on consulting. We try to rotate people through projects so they don't get bored. None of our projects are very boring, though: we've built open source products, worked with non-profits and for-profits alike in multiple domains (startups, health, e-commerce, "the enterprise", news media, climate change awareness, and event management). We have Haskell classes in the evening. We love riding bicycles, bird-watching, and playing guitar. There are a thousand ways we can do better and we're going to try.

We would love it if you can help us be better.

Nilenso has a culture of constant improvement; we expect it from ourselves, from each other, and from everyone we consider hiring. An extensive library and frequent conference attendence act as our baseline, but the greatest lever we have is pushing each other to do better. Some recent topics: Could we use big data to help solve Bangalore's infrastructural challenges? Could we become a purely open source consultancy? How can we ensure that even our hardest projects always have a sustainable pace?

Our backend code is almost entirely in Clojure, with a dash of Javascript, C++, Java, Ruby, and Objective-C in the five places those five languages make sense. We've spent significant time scaling and squeazing runtime performance out of Postgres and analytics performance out of HBase and Redshift. Sometimes we use code to make music or poetry. Most of our code is on the backend, and it makes a lot of sense to us to write backend code in a LISP on the JVM, but we're not wedded to it. "Best tool for the job" applies at nilenso -- but the "best" tool needs to be quantified with facts. We love facts. We might be knee-deep in Swift or Rust or Go or Haskell or C or .NET (who knows) next year and we're looking for other open-minded developers to share their curiosity with us.

As part of a consultancy, you will be talking to your customer. A lot. We have daily meetings with our clients every morning or every evening (depending on their timezones). More and more we're finding clients in India/Asia, which we like. However, the past year has sent everyone from our staff overseas to meet their clients face-to-face; we're more than the far side of a Skype conversation.
Job Perks
Perks at nilenso are defined by everyone. We have parking for your bicycle, motorbike, and car. We provide health insurance to everyone on staff. Kitty or Abhinav might make you a delicious Aeropress coffee if you ask nicely... otherwise we get Kumbakonum Degree Filter Coffee delivered and masala chai made in-house. Don't like masala chai? We have a mountain of other tea. We have free lunch. We try to host as many educational events as we can at the office. We want you to meet your client and attend conferences, whether that's a bicycle ride to Jayanagar or a flight around the world. This year, we attended a ton of conferences: JSFoo, rootconf, Clojure/conj, RubyConf San Diego, React Conf SF, StrangeLoop, GCRC, Clojure/West, RubyConf India, Fifth Elephant, and probably one or two we've forgotten. We have company outings sometimes and sometimes we just lounge around the office and watch movies on the projector. If there's a way we can make the office more comfortable or fun, we'll do it.

We'll give you all the standard junk to get your job done: a comfy chair and desk, a laptop of your choice (most of us have 15" MacBook Pros but we don't discriminate) and a full workstation. We'll get you software licenses and a 4G data dongle if you need to work from the train. If we can help you with something else, just ask. We'll try.

Some perks aren't selfish. We try to contribute collectively to charities. We have a composter for our wet waste, a leaf composter for the neighbourhood, and recycling for everything else. We host daily English lessons. You can help with any or none of these, as you like, but they'll make you feel good, which is the ultimate perk, isn't it?

We're looking for an android developer to join us full time and help us lead the mobile audio revolution.
A bit about Triveous and Skyro:

Triveous is a small, early stage, Bangalore based startup and we’re working to revolutionise how audio and audio metadata can be captured and shared on a mobile device. People across the world use our product Skyro to record meetings, conversations, lessons, conferences, music sessions and lots more.
Even though audio recorders are a dime a dozen, the popular productivity blog MakeUseOf has recently called Skyro the best android audio recorder app out there. We want you to help us create the next, more connected version of Skyro and take us to 1+ million downloads.
Currently the app has over 350k downloads and is available in 15 languages, it has been featured internationally on the play in multiple categories and has been covered in sites like MakeUseOf, Lifehacker, Beautiful Pixels, ProductHunt and multiple other international blogs.
To know more about Skyro, have a look at our site and this video

Our philosophy

Skyro has been designed, developed and tested by just 2 people. We believe that a small focused team giving its best everyday is probably the best way of creating simple, beautiful, hi-impact and hi-quality applications.
We try to stay at the cutting edge of android development and we believe in experimenting and adopting new technology at a very rapid pace. (For example: we're experimenting with RxAndroid and Espresso now)
We’re also big proponents of the android community, we’re active members of Blrdroid, one of the largest android groups in the world and we’ve collaborated with many startups, developers and designers over the years.

What we're looking for

Can-do attitude. Most of the stuff we’re doing seems outright crazy to do at the design/architecture stage, we need someone who is not daunted by the task.
Experience: We're looking for a person who has worked on android apps before and know's his/her way around android
Solid java fundamentals
An app in the play store (or something else like an open source project) to showcase the work you’ve done
Familiarity with android studio, gradle, the play store, app usage patterns, android ux principles, image loading libraries, networking libraries
Good to have: Experience with network and data heavy applications, experience with service design
Good to have: Experience with espresso (or robotium), the new android unit test framework (or roboelectric), spoon
Good to have: Contribution to open source

We're on a mission to get all travel businesses online. And we want to make it super-easy for them. Which makes it super-hard for us. It is hard to take a complex offline process and convert it into a few effortless clicks on the browser. Or a few taps on the mobile.
Good design and good usability are not buzz words for us. It's our raison d'être. Our apps are second nature to our customers. And we don't want it any other way.
As we scale our business and add more products to our roadmap, we need UI/UX designers who share our passion for simplicity.
We're looking for designers:

Who can get into the skin of the user and come up with simple and elegant UI mockups to solve a problem.
Who are experienced with modern tools for wireframing (Balsamiq, Moqups, Inkspace, etc.) and tools for high-fidelity mockups (Illustrator, Photoshop etc.)
With excellent communication skills, who believe that copywriting is an integral part of the design process. (Have you ever obsessed on what a form field should be labelled? How best to describe WHAT to enter in a form field?)
Who can convert their designs to functional HTML &amp; CSS prototypes. (We will love you if you can do this. If not, you should be able to work with a junior dev to get this done.)

If the thought of solving hard problems excites you; if having your fingerprints all over our core products gets you going; and if you'd like to do this while working with a super-charged team in Goa; drop us a line. We're eager to hear from you.
About the company

Graphics Designer (2 -5 years experience)
Role &amp; Responsibilities 
For a brand to stand out and be remembered, it NEEDS great design. Great design not only with regards its consumer facing packaging, but across all its consumer touch points.
In fact we @ SkillzotBiz don’t see design as a differentiator but a driver of the business. In the case of SkillzotBiz, this is right from the portal interface, to online and offline marketing collaterals and communication for the B2B segment.
We are changing the way Presentations are made in India. Presentations are no longer boring slides ridden with bullets. They are stories we tell. So in essence, think visually rich story books, right from book cover design (the presentation title slide), to billboards (each slide) to funky and whacky illustrations, icons and images.
The role is one that calls for the creation of a visual story. On a broad level it involves a mix of graphic design and illustrations along with opportunities to hone copywriting skills if you so wish to. (In fact it’s a plus)
Key responsibilities will be - 

Slide ware design for presentations – create illustrations, design background, images, colour palettes, templates for presentation slide ware (Presentations are no longer what they were, they are taking a new leap in design. Each presentation is designed as if it were a book/magazine/brochure/marketing collateral. Take a look at these amazing presentations - http://workawesome.com/communication/top-10-coolest-powerpoint-slideshows-slideshare/ and http://www.slideshare.net/ethos3/how-to-be-a-presentation-god
Design and implement public facing web-pages, templates, e-mailers and marketing elements based on SkillzotBiz brand guidelines
Creating illustrations for social media content and infographics
Copywriting (optional) - at various customer interface points, including e-mails &amp; key marketing areas

Skills/Traits required 

Exceptional visual design. The ability to look at a script and convert it to a visual story
Proficiency with photoshop/Illustrator and PowerPoint (we can teach PowerPoint)
Knack for whacky and funky design
Self-driven and passionate to create brilliant design and initiate ideas that will help the brand stand out
Really excellent attention to detail
Open to iterative process of development - there will be continual research and feedback to help improve the product, so an open mind set of 'learning and correcting' on the go is necessary
Sense of humour

Added information

Part-time option is also there with flexibility of work hours and working from home with deliverables as per timelines as key focus

We are always building new things. We have lots of data. We use it to generate analytics and actionable predictions. We are scaling up fast, so our software needs to handle scale gracefully.If you enjoy building software, this is a wonderful place to be in.Typical Day at the JobHere is how a typical day will look like. You start by looking the status of the production dashboard, new support requests and bugs. With a quick scan you find that that the message counts are not getting updated after the code push last night. You jump on it right way and send a short code-review out, after testing it on your staging setup.With that out of the way, you get back to the feature that you have been working on. You know exactly why you are building this feature and what impact it will have on the customers. The feature was specced out last week in some intense design discussions. You finished a quick prototype yesterday. You throw it out today and start the code and unit testing for the initial release. The plan is to deploy a basic version this week sometime, gather feedback over a few days and then fine-tune it based on what the customers say.Just after lunch, while you code, you come across a bug in the queuing sub-system. You decide that it would be simple for you to fix it as well and so you do. While you fixed the bug, you thought about how you can make the queuing system much more scalable. You write a quick note to yourself to talk about it later.By the end of the day you'll have a good chunk of the new feature implemented. You'll send that queuing system bug fix for code-review tomorrow morning and continue your work of the new feature.

Hey guys, Headstart Higher is back in Bangalore! If you wish to apply as a startup or candidate, please visit and register yourselves here - http://higher.headstart.in/bengaluru/If you don't know about Headstart Higher, here is a quick brief. Headstart Higher is India's most successful startup hiring event. We shortlist outstanding candidates from a pool of applicants. On an average, each candidate gets shortlisted by 6 startups. 50% of the candidates get job offers from multiple startups. 
How is this different from other job fairs?It is different on two counts. One, only startups (very young companies) are allowed to hire in a Higher event. Two, you will undergo a selection before you are allowed to participate.
Working with a startup has its own challenges and opportunities. If you  don’t understand what it takes, read on further. If you do, move on to register yourself by giving in the relevant details. If we like your profile, we will tell you how to buy a Candidate Ticket to confirm your seat. We collect a fee of 500 INR to ensure the seriousness and commitment of applicants. If shortlisted we'll share an exclusive 50% HasJob discount coupon with you. 
Risks and Rewards of joining a startup:Joining a startup is nothing like joining another job. It demands long working hours, responsibility, ownership and a lot of passion. In many cases, the startup may not pay you even half as much as your current salary and would perhaps demand double the amount of work. (However we have a few funded startups as well, who are able to offer very competitive salary packages). 
What is on offer is your shot at changing the world by building a business that provides innovative products and services or does it more efficiently than most others in the world. The risk that you take on your salary is compensated either with some equity in the organisation or simply the fast growth and learning if the company does well. 
Why you shouldn’t join a startup:
You should clearly not join a startup if any of the  following is true:

You have a high commitment on the income you take home. For example, if you are servicing a huge home-loan.
You have a family that demands loads of attention. For example, if you are expecting arrival of your first child in next few months.
You are unable to get through other jobs and are looking at this as an option for time being. Joining a startup is a long-term commitment.
You care a lot about the brand name of the company you join. It is quite likely that no one in your circle has heard about the startup you work for, or will hear about it in near future.

Why you may join a startup
There are some people who have natural inclination towards startups:

You are known for taking initiatives among your friends. You happen to be the one person who organises all get-togethers and you love it.
You love the freedom at your workplace. You would find it cool to come to office whenever you like to and work late-hours. Startups usually don’t have a in-time out-time policy.
You think you work best when you are left unsupervised. There are usually not enough people in a startup to monitor you.
You are a programmer but love to try your hand at dabble online marketing, sales and making coffee, or any other way around.

All said and done, working in startups is a rewarding experience. The learning curve is 3x compared to roles in big companies. If your startup does well, you grow very fast. If it tanks, you would still have many job options (given your learning curve). Chances are you'll get some equity or at least excellent stock options and this may translate into a good deal of cash if your company makes a handsome exit (probability less than 2% though). Registration Link: http://higher.headstart.in/bengaluru/ 
Headstart Higher is organised by Headstart Network Foundation. It's a pan India non-profit organisation committed to building a thriving ecosystem for entrepreneurs in India. Other initiatives by Headstart include - Startup Saturdays, Headstart Clubs, Co-founder Search and more. Note: Due to limitations of the platform, the salary has been depicted to range between 3 &amp; 12 Lk INR. In the past much higher compensation packages have been offered to outstanding candidates by funded startups.

Tookitaki is a marketing analytics/intelligence company. We work on consumer behaviour prediction and modeling. To augment our ongoing work,  we want to hire a senior programmer in our backend team. 
The right candidate for this job will have built large scale machine learning based systems using some map-reduce paradigm and infrastructure. For example - You could have implemented a clustering algorithm that uses unstructured data sets of a couple gigs. You could have done this using Spark or Mahout or just your own implementation on top of a map reduce framework such as Hadoop.
What we are trying to solve is very open ended - so you have to be ok with a lot of ambiguity and randomness. More than anything you should be willing to experiment a lot and fail fast. 
Should this pique your interest, please reach out to us and apply. We are a very open company and we have raised a million $ seed round. We are generous with salary and other perks. We are located in a very serene neighbourhood in Koramangala. 
What will the interview be like - Well there will be no interviewing - We have tried telephonic and other interviewing techniques in the past and we have realized the best way to hire is to plainly see how you work with us. So we want you to spend a day with us and hack on our problems. 
Obviously we cannot ask everyone who applies to come and spend a day with us. So our first filter is your github/bitbucket profile. If you don't have such a profile just send us a plain text of your resume and some code that you have written.
We really are not interested in the number of years you have worked - what we are interstesd is in your ability to build large scale learning systems. So the senior tag in the JD is not for the number of years of experience but for your collective ML skill set.

Send us some self assessed scores for the job requirements listed above. -- Don't you bullshit us, we're going to find out during the Skype call so don't waste your time or ours. -- Answer honestly, maybe we don't give as much importance to SQL as you think so 6/10 is fine. E-mail us an excerpts of some code you've written that you're proud of. -- Tell us why out of all the code you've written in your life you decided to send us that.
