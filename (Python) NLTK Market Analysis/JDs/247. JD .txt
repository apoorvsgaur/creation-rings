
Nothing is as effective as meeting, talking to each other face-to-face, discovering each other. No tests, no CVs, no timepass. If you match the below criteria, lets meet for coffee, we'll pay for your coffee and show you our product, you tell us about yourself and let's take it on from there.
We're looking for someone who hates jobs and the status quo, someone who thrives on disruption and can live with the chaos of a Startup. We're looking for someone who thrives on human relationships and trust and who believes nothing is impossible. Someone who, no matter how much he knows or doesnt know now, is confident enough of learning and getting the job done. If we like each other and you join now, chances are you get to be at the Core of what we envision to be amongst India's most dynamic Education-Social Media Startups.
