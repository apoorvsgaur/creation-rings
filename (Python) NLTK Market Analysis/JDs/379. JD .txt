An Introduction:
Prototyze is a startup with a difference. We were off the ground in October 2014, and are already now working on a slew of mobile-first products. While we may be a young start-up, we have an organizational history that is 15-years old, with Synapse (http://www.synapse.co), ScreenRoot (http://www.screenroot.com), Visual Juju (http://www.visualjuju.com) as sister organizations. Our strong lineage and profitable years means that we are able to seed fund all these products ourselves, and already have a strong organizational infrastructure and support.
