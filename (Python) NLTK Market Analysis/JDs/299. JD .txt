
Rocketium is a learning platform that helps college students and working professionals develop skills for personal and career growth. We are using an innovative game-based approach to teach concepts and let users apply the learning immediately using engaging games. Think of our app as a mini-App Store for skills. We believe that an addictive, engaging, and always-on platform is the best way to help the world really learn complex or abstract concepts.
Our powerful personalised learning platform is based on solid research and built in conjunction with researchers and practitioners. At launch, we will have topics such as time management, creativity, conflict resolution, influence, leadership, communication, and more. Over time, we aim to open up our platform to experts so they can teach the world a diverse and and ever-growing range of skills.

We are a mobile-only company, so everything that a user sees is something that you create. Other apps in related areas have been Apple's App of the Year in 2013 (Duolingo, gamified language learning) and 2014 (Elevate, gamified brain training). No pressure.
