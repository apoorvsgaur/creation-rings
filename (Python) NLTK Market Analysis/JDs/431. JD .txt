Things you will NOT get at Equal Experts:
Fancy designation - You will be called a Software Engineer here, regardless of your experience / expertise.
Projects on only 1 language - Today you might code in Java, tomorrow in Groovy, the day after in Scala... :-). At Equal Experts, we work on diverse tech-stacks and you simply have to be a polyglot.
A routine "desk job" - As a consultant, you WILL travel onsite...quite often. You are expected to work directly with clients whether you are onsite / offshore. You may not live out of your suitcase here..but will have to keep your passport handy.. :-)
"Management" role - We don't hire dedicated PMs, IMs, DMs ..or any other Ms out there... :-). If you are part of Equal Experts, you'll always be a hands-on techie..
Spoonfeeding... :-)

Conceptual understanding of whatever you've worked on - We're more interested in knowing how &amp; why you used a particular technology / approach to solve a problem. Definitions and theory don't interest us that much... :-)
