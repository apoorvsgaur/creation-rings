
Required experience includes:

Linux and Windows administration
Network engineering that includes both LAN and WAN design, not just maintenance
MySQL, MongoDB, or other database expertise (you name it, we probably use it)
Experience using Amazon EC2 enough to have a strong opinion
Automation! We use Chef as well as our own tools. What do you use?

Ideally you can answer most of these questions:

What’s an availability zone?
RAID-5 or RAID-10?
Why does Munin not scale?
What’s worse, jitter or latency?
How can you use 95p to get free transit? (not that we’ve ever done that)
What are the (fewest) flags needed for ffmpeg to extract a single audio stream from a WebM file to an audio file that can play on an iPod shuffle?

What about the bonus skills?

Experience with python or ruby
Extensive knowledge of H.323, SIP, XMPP, and any other buzzworthy technology in video / voice conferencing
BGP, OSPF, ECMP, other buzzworthy neteng acronyms.

What would a typical day be like?

On-call rotates, just wanted to get that out of the way
Ops works closely with the dev team and product management, very closely, so you must play nice with others
Everyone juggles long-term projects with real-time monitoring and triage. How? Communication… so excellent communication is needed all the time
