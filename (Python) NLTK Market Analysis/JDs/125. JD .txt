Beaconifi is a promising start-up which was selected as one of the Top 20 Hottest Tech Startups of 2014 by India's premier Tech-focused magazine Exhibit from over 500+ entries. Brick and mortar Retailers are struggling in India (and worldwide) to compete with the online eTailers. They need to understand the demographic profile of their users, their buying habits depending on time/day of the week and able to roll out personalized and instant offers accordingly when the customer is in the vicinity or inside the Store/Mall. They need to customize the offers optimally utilizing the Inventory and PoS data. Otherwise they are going to keep losing market share to the online eTailers ! This is where Beaconifi products will help Brick and mortar Retailers gain market share from online eTailers.
