
We're on a mission to get all travel businesses online. And we want to make it super-easy for them. Which makes it super-hard for us. It is hard to take a complex offline process and convert it into a few effortless clicks on the browser. Or a few taps on the mobile.
Good design and good usability are not buzz words for us. It's our raison d'être. Our apps are second nature to our customers. And we don't want it any other way.
As we scale our business and add more products to our roadmap, we need UI/UX designers who share our passion for simplicity.
We're looking for designers:

Who can get into the skin of the user and come up with simple and elegant UI mockups to solve a problem.
Who are experienced with modern tools for wireframing (Balsamiq, Moqups, Inkspace, etc.) and tools for high-fidelity mockups (Illustrator, Photoshop etc.)
With excellent communication skills, who believe that copywriting is an integral part of the design process. (Have you ever obsessed on what a form field should be labelled? How best to describe WHAT to enter in a form field?)
Who can convert their designs to functional HTML &amp; CSS prototypes. (We will love you if you can do this. If not, you should be able to work with a junior dev to get this done.)

If the thought of solving hard problems excites you; if having your fingerprints all over our core products gets you going; and if you'd like to do this while working with a super-charged team in Goa; drop us a line. We're eager to hear from you.
