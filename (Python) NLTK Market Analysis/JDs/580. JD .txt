
galleri5 is an upcoming social discovery platform for authentic &amp; original user content. The platform allows users to share their original content (images &amp; videos) from social platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Flickr, Vine, Youtube) on the platform's galleries which can be discovered by other users. It also doubles up as a marketplace, where end-users and organizations can buy this content legally from the galleries, allowing content creators to earn money from their creations.

If you're passionate about building the next frontier in user content discovery based on social networking, we're looking for you! If you would like to work with a passionate team of founders that has amazing pedigree and deep business understanding, along with great connections in the VC ecosystem, look no further.
