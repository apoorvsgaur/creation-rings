
We're looking to hire a super-charged, young &amp; impatient guy for our developer relations &amp; content marketing efforts. You should be an 'ideas' guy conducting some experimental projects for us, dig in and execute things we've figured out already.
The role involves doing video interviews with people across the world (so, your English has to be top-notch), writing, research and quite a lot of grunt work as well. It involves multiple time zones. So you'd work from afternoon till midnight (2 PM - 12 AM).Â
