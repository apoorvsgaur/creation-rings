To implement our vision, Canvs.in is developing to become an avante garde portfolio and merchandising platform for artists. As of today, 100+ artists have already joined and submitted their portfolio to be put up on the platform along with two advisors, one of who, is the Dean at JJ School of Arts, Prof Manisha Patil, who is also a routine exhibitionist herself.
The platform shall be to showcase portfolios elaborately, sell artwork on merchandise, search and discover artists and artwork, getting in touch with artists and helping artists to connect and collaborate with each other online. The problem to be solved is  the massive gap in the demand and the supply end in Graphic Art and scale the the solution.
The product is intended to be heavy in tech, with future prospects delving into data sciences.

We are hence looking to land someone who can join us in this venture as a partner. You shall not be expected to work full time as of now, although we do, hence their is no requirement for you to drop what you are doing and jump ship.  :)
