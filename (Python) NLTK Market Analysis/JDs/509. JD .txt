
I run www.anirudh.me and india.media.mit.edu and other couple websites, of our research lab. Need help with someone who can help with couple websites, redesigned.
Its technically simple, and would require you to spend a day morning to evening, at our lab. Hopefully a day should be enough.
Will be happy to credit the developer and pay honorarium for the contributation, and allow access to our hardware/fablab :)
