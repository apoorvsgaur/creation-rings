
I am the founder of AeroLeads, a bootstrapped startup based out of Bangalore with 1000+ B2B users in just 4 months. We are building an android app for our product and looking for a technically strong developer on Android. 
I have built multiple products in the past so won't give you the typical sales pitch of how we are changing the world and denting/benting the universe etc :) We know what we do and what we want to do and looking for few good men to join us, right now, a single android developer who has good expeirence in building scalable apps.
We are pretty laidback people, do office gossip, work 35-40 hours a week, come early, leave late, bring our own laptops (and girlfriends too!), watch youtube, FRIENDS and browse facebook during office hours etc. 
Ideally I want someone for full time position but initially want to work on contract basis to minimize the risk for both of us. 
Our office is in Koramangala, Bangalore.
