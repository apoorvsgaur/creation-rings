
I'm looking for a freelance manufacturing engineer experienced in CAD/CAM that can analyze drawings of machined/fabricated metal parts and identify the various steps involved in transforming raw material to finished part. This is a one-time requirement for now, but can translate into a recurring engagement if successful. The current requirement is for a 1-2 weeks.Â 
I know that this is a tech-oriented forum but this is an urgent requirement and any suggestions would be appreciated.
