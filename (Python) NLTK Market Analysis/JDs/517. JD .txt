Of course, add to it that, your time and money is invested at this event, and apart from having a little bit of fun here, you certainly have your business objectives.

You got couple of more hours. Wondering whom to speak to, to get the maximum mutual benefit?

What if a magical wand can show you 'the folks' that you should connect with?
We're starting out on a journey from this premise.But then, we believe that there's a better way in which technology could be used to build professional and biz relationships in today's world. 
And that being linked to multiple connections is just simply, (hands down) not enough!.
