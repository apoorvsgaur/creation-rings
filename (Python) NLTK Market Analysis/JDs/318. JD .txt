
We are a young startup looking to disrupt the food industry. What we can offer is an opportunity to work on products which can change the world and a chance toÂ connect to some of the best engineering minds in the industry. We are looking for a couple of android and java engineers, typically freshers. You must have developed an app to apply for the android positions, so please include links wherever possible. Our application's backend is currently on spring. So any experience in Spring is a bonus. We are looking for atleast 3 months commitment.
