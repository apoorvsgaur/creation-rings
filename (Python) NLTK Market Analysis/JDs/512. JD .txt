
Redd is a company that's done some amazing work for fantastic start-ups like Urban Ladder, NoBroker, Knowlarity, Eat Shop Love, Intelligent Breast Exam and several others. We work with software and are quickly branching off the screen to work on hardware technologies as well. We are looking for smart people who are opinionated about design and interactions principles to come and be a part of a team that's working on some cutting edge projects that are going to influence the future for all of us. 
While we'd prefer full-time workers, if you're good at what you do, we can work with you on a part-time basis as well.
