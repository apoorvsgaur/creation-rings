
We're a 1.5 yr old startup selected by Unreasonable At Sea (by Unreasonable Institute &amp; co-founder of Stanford d.school) as one of the Top 11 global tech startups in the social impact space. We launched Guru-G, the world's first gamified platform for teaching &amp; teacher-training in Dec 2013 after validating our early prototypes in 5 countries. We now work with 400+ schools who signed up for the academic year of 2014-15.
We're looking for android developers to join a new team we're putting together that will work on designing &amp; developing the next version of our product from scratch while our current team will focus on growing &amp; scaling up our current version. You will be working directly with the founding team to conceptualize, prototype, validate, design &amp; develop the product. Your chances will go up significantly if you -
- have conceptualized &amp; built a product on your own before
- have demonstrated a passion to learn skills beyond your core area of expertise
- are super honest in communication &amp; don't use buzzwords just to sound cool
- can play a musical instrument
- love playing Poker and/or Mafia
As for work hours, it's up to you when and how you want to work with your team. Our lab will be open 24x7. You will be surrounded by quite a few youngsters and students who may or may not be our employees and building cool things that may or may not have anything to do with our startup. In short: be prepared to work in a chaotic, hierarchy-less, rapidly changing work environment filled with distractions.
As for incentives - if we like you enough, we'll make you an offer you can't refuse :)
