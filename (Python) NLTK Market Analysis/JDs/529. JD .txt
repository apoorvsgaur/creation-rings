
At Marvel Fresh, we strive to build a better eco-system for the fruits and vegetables produced by the farming community with great efforts. Our team works tirelessly in connect with the various stakeholders involved in this chain to find better and better ways to bring maximum efficiency in the current unorganized system. Our attempt is to bring consumers the most fresh and the best quality fruits and vegetables at affordable prices.
We are not looking for just a web or app developer(though it should be on your fingertips), but someone who is passionate about startups. No one is going to tell you when or where you should work. Actually we expect you to tell us what and how you are going to do it. Be ready to burn the midnight oil, and to party hard as well. 
Freshers are always welcome!
