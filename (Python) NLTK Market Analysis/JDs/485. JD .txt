
Hello there disruptors,
I am looking for some awesome tech visionaries to come onboard. We already have one senior developer producing an awesomeÂ MVP as we speak - on MEAN stack, and we are talking to multiple (very strong education / experience) candidates currently. The idea/model has been receiving extensive positive feedback, and investors already want to put their money into it.
About the venture: The venture is a disruptive concept in the proptech space and has been getting huge interest from agents/landlords/investors/tenants. On offer - cash /+ equity + joining now would mean 1) getting a senior entry into the venture very early on, 2) would help shape the series of products we have planned for over the next 2-3 years.
About me: - Ex-Strategy/M&amp;A Consultant - Oxford MBA - Extensive network within PE/VC space - Worked extensively with VC/PE funds over the last 3 years - LI profile: uk.linkedin.com/pub/saurabh-saxena/1/61a/1b/
What I am looking for: - Tech lead/Full stack developer. Ideally MEAN stack, but open to hungry smart people who are not on it, but intend to build their skills quickly. Uni.+ 0-3 years ideally in startups where s/he scaled a product quickly, and found the coolest/most creative ways to solve the business problem - (Good to have) Experience hiring, mentoring and retaining a tech team - Good academic background - Bonus, if understands business side of things - No requirement of working in proptech, would prefer someone with strong aptitude, experience in building complex web/mobile products + hunger, over domain expertise.
ALSO HIRING- Operations head (London based), and summer interns (London based)
- Absolutely essential: If you have a prescribed way of thinking (within the box), disruptRE is not for you... Please apply ONLY if you believe you think of, and provide solutions to real world problems in ways that no one else does. I want to build an A+ team, who think out of the box, set very high standards for themselves, and then put their heart and soul to go and achieve the goals!
Does this sound like you, then we can talk further...thanks.
Best, Saurabh

Global mobility. Will be launching a rotation programme later, to ensure people from London / Indian offices move around and share best practices.
